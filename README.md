# Isntructions to setup

Make sure you have python3.10. Optionally, you can create a python3.10 environment using conda if you are dealing with multiple python versions. 

After cloning the repo, use the install.sh file to install necessary packages by running 
```bash
./install.sh 
```
This will ensure that you have a virtual environment where all packages are installed. 

Once the packages are installed, we will use Jupyterlab or Notebook for the tutorial session. 

I have provided a sample skyimage file (h5) for this tutorial shared in googledrive folder.
